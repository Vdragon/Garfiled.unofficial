Introduction
----------------------
GARFILED (no, I didn't misspell anyone's name here) is a garbage file
generator. It can generate files of any given size quickly and accurately.
You can specify the size in bytes, KBytes, MBytes or any combination of them.
You can also customize the BYTE value used to fill the file with; either by
specifying a value between 0 and 255 or by letting the system use a random value
for each byte.
For usage instructions just execute the program with no parameters.
